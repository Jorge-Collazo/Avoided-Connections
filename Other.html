                        So I was walking my dog around the neighborhood, and I found this weird guy staring at us while watering 
                        his plants. It sounds kind of mean now that Iâ€™m doing it, but he has a cone shaped head with black hair 
                        that grows upward. He never once, not once, closed his eyes. So it made me really uncomfortable.

                        I was walking home from work and I heard a noise in the grass next to me. I thought nothing of it, as I thought it 
                        was an animal, and keep walking, but then I heard it again... and a whisper. I didn't realise what it was or that 
                        is was a person until I looked to my left and saw him. He had black hair and was staring at me. That freaked me out 
                        and I started running. As i was running I heard him in the grass running after me, screaming. I made it to my 
                        neighborhood and he stopped chasing me. that was one of the scariest things I have seen.
