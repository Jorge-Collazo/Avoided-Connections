                        Please watch your children when you’re at a crowded mall. This weekend, I was trying to buy my 6 year old son 
                        some candy, and he walked away to find a table in the food court while I fumbled with my wallet, trying to pay 
                        the vendor. When I turned to look for my son, I found him 50 yards away, walking hand in hand with a guy in a 
                        clown costume, I had to run and hold my son away from him. While the clown ran out of the mall.

                        The mall is a weird place, especially around Halloween! 
                        So I was walking around looking to buy some new shoes, and I see this couple. 
                        They were walking around in really weird costumes and would just stare people down as people walked by them. 
                        It was kind of creepy but then again it was almost Halloween, so I wasn’t sure what to think. 
                        I hope it was just a one time thing and it never happens again.
