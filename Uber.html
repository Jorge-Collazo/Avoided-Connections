                        Make sure to check your Uber app before getting in a car. Last night I was waiting for my Uber and a car pulled up, 
                        and the driver asked if I was Devyn, I am, so I assumed he was my Uber and got in the car. Once he started moving, he 
                        locked the doors and went in the opposite direction of the place I wanted to go. I immediately panicked and looked at 
                        my app to find that my Uber driver was still five minutes away from where they were supposed to pick me up. So I 
                        attacked the driver which made him stop the car, and I was able to slam the button on the passenger door to unlock the 
                        doors and get out. I ran faster than I ever have in my whole life.

                    I work as an Uber driver for most of the day and this has to be one of the worst customers I’ve ever had. 
                    It seemed to be a couple and when they got inside everything seemed fine. 
                    They were apparently named chris white and christy white but I’m not sure if it was their real names. 
                    Everything was going fine until they got into an argument. 
                    I don’t remember what it was about but chris white started to hit his wife! 
                    This lasted for about five minutes before they calmed down and when we arrived at their destination. 
                    I honestly hope I never have to deal with anything like this ever again.
