                            Um, I’m not quite sure how to really talk about this. But just a little while ago, I was on the subway on my 
                            way back home. Not only was he staring at me the whole time, but he even rubbed my hand a little bit. I 
                            absolutely NEVER want to see that guy again. Anyone else, be on the lookout for a well dressed, blonde haired, 
                            five foot nine guy. Also, his nails were really long. SO GROSS!

                            Japanese people. I can’t really stand some of ‘em. I just met this one earlier today who we ran into in the 
                            underground walkway. I don’t know what kind of supplements this guy is is supposed to be on, but he was 
                            unnaturally muscular, not also mentioning that he was six and a half feet tall. Either way, this dude, out 
                            of nowhere, punched my wife, in her face simply for being in his way. I don’t know if he wears that particular 
                            outfit normally, but he was wearing a long, navy blue jacket and pants with a pink shirt.
