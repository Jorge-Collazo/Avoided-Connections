                            I met this girl today who I had mistaken for Billie Eilish. I met her in this eatery for breakfast. She sat at a 
                            nearby table holding a lunch tray with various food items on it. In any case, I went up to her and begged her 
                            for an autograph. I was really disappointed, because apparently she’s a: Jolene Coojoh or something. I searched 
                            it up later and she’s a real prison convict, who recently was released. Fellow Floridians, watch yourselves.

                            Met this guy at Burger King today. He might be messed up in the head or something, but I really don’t know. 
                            He’s got this messed up haircut, and was really loud. Talking to his friend Joe Sukay, anyway, he was yelling 
                            at the manager and anyone else who wanted to talk to him. Believe it or not, but that’s not all. He even 
                            randomly took a handful of my fries. He might be Japanese, because his name was Okuyasu.

                            So I went out to buy a drink, and as I was waiting for my drink this weird man started talking to me. At first 
                            I tried ignoring him but then he got up in my face and started talking about how he loves children and how he 
                            really wants children. This of course creeped me out and so I told him I didn’t really feel like talking. He 
                            told me that was alright and stopped talking. I thought it was over but he wouldn’t stop staring at me, and when
                            I left he tried following me until I got into my car. If anyone sees someone who looks like the man below please
                            be careful.
