                            Um, I’m not quite sure how to really talk about this. But just a little while ago, I was on the subway on my 
                            way back home. Not only was he staring at me the whole time, but he even rubbed my hand a little bit. I 
                            absolutely NEVER want to see that guy again. Anyone else, be on the lookout for a well dressed, blonde haired, 
                            five foot nine guy. Also, his nails were really long. SO GROSS!

                            I honestly CANNOT deal with people nowadays. I met this terrible guy today who literally has no soul. I 
                            ended up bringing my dog to my local dog park, and Cherry is an innocent little thing who wouldn’t hurt anybody, 
                            so I’m sure you could tell how appalled I was when this blonde englishman actually kicked my 
                            adorable little Bichon Frise at least two feet away from him! Why would you even go to a dog park if you
                            were gonna do something like that? If I can remember correctly, I think his last name was Branco.
